# BIOPYTHON BEGINNER EXERCISE

## Overview:
Welcome to the Biopython Beginner Exercises repository! This repository is designed for individuals looking to practice and enhance their skills in bioinformatics using Biopython. It contains several Jupyter notebooks that guide users through various basic operations in Biopython, along with the necessary datasets and output files from the code runs.

## Repository Structure
### datasets: 
This folder contains all the datasets required for the exercises.
### [Module1_biopython.ipynb](./practice_exercise_1.py):
The first module introduces the basics of Biopython and provides exercises for hands-on practice.
### Module2_Biopython.ipynb:
The second module builds upon the first, exploring more advanced Biopython features and operations.
### Module3_Biopython.ipynb: 
The third module focuses on specific applications of Biopython, allowing users to implement their knowledge.

## Getting Started
To get started with the exercises in this repository, follow these steps:

FIRST OPEN THE NOTEBOOK 
You can access the following Jupyter Notebooks directly from this repository:

1. [Module 1: Biopython](https://github.com/Epsiba-23/biopython-beginner-exercises/blob/main/Module1_biopython.ipynb) click this link to open 1st module 
2. [Module 2: Biopython](https://github.com/Epsiba-23/biopython-beginner-exercises/blob/main/Module2_Biopython.ipynb) click this link to open 2nd module 
3. [Module 3: Biopython](https://github.com/Epsiba-23/biopython-beginner-exercises/blob/main/Module3_biopython.ipynb) click this link to open 3rd module 
4. [Module 4: KEGG](https://github.com/Epsiba-23/biopython-beginner-exercises/blob/main/Module4_kegg.ipynb) click this link to open 4th module

### once opened the notebook follow the below steps for running the notebook 

## Running the Notebook

### 1) BY DOWNLOADING THE FILE DIRECTLY TO YOUR PC.

1. **Download the Notebook**:
   - Click on the **"Download"** button on the notebook page to download the `.ipynb` file.

2. **Upload to Google Drive**:
   - Go to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/).
   - Click on the **"+ New"** button on the left sidebar.
   - Select **"File upload,"** and upload the downloaded `.ipynb` file.

3. **Open in Google Colab**:
   - Once uploaded, right-click on the notebook file in Google Drive.
   - Choose **"Open with" > "Google Colaboratory."**

OR 3. **Open Google Colab**:
   - Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

 **Connect Google Colab to Google Drive**:
   - In Colab, click on **"File"** in the top menu, then select **"Open notebook."**
   - In the dialog that appears, click on the **"Google Drive"** tab.
   - Click on the **"Connect to Google Drive"** button. You may be prompted to grant permissions for Colab to access your Drive.

 **Open Your Notebook**:
   - After connecting, you should see your uploaded notebook in the Google Drive tab.
   - Click on your notebook file to open it in Google Colab.

6. **Run the Notebook**:
   - You can now run the cells in the notebook. Click on a cell and press **Shift + Enter** to execute it.

### Note
Make sure to have required datasets downloaded and also uploaded in the drive to run the notebook smoothly.

## Mount Google Drive:
 make sure to mount your Google Drive in your notebook. You can do this by running the following code snippet in a cell:

python- Copy code: DONE TO ALL MODULE NOTEBOOK.
```
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
 ```


### Access the Datasets in notebook: 
Use the path /content/drive/MyDrive/ followed by the path to your datasets in your code to access them.

To get the path to the file name mentioned in the notebook.
example: if there is path > /drive/my drive/EXAMPLE/org.headers.text 

navigate to that particular file 'org.headers.text in ur drive and copy the path 

 Go to file icon in your notebook in left side go to drive> mydrive> org.headers.text & click on the three dots on the file and select the option copy path and paste it.  

### note: drive will be accessible only if u run the the above code for all notebooks that is  after mounting the google drive to the colab.

### Run the Code:
Execute the cells in the Jupyter notebooks to practice the various Biopython functionalities.

### Output Files
The notebooks will generate output files based on the exercises and operations performed. Make sure to check the corresponding output files for the results of your code runs.

## Conclusion
This repository serves as a practical resource for anyone interested in learning and practicing Biopython. Feel free to explore the notebooks, experiment with the code, and enhance your bioinformatics skills!
